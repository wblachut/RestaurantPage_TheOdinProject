## PROJECT: RESTAURANT PAGE

Project is a part of The Odin Project [JavaScript learning curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript). To learn more open the [TOP assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/restaurant-page).

## Description

This is a first `The Odin Project` webpage build with application of webpack. The aim of it was to create a simple restaurant homepage dynamically rendering content. The entire content is rendered using JavaScript alone. Tab-switching is run by js function inside `index.js`. For me the final outcome is not desired outcome! Building this project I would try to make the design look way more modern. Design is inspired on... Autumn, since I was coding it in time of the "Polish Golden Fall". In that time of a year I am used to put more orangish and reddish ingredients like pumpkins or beetroot to meals I prepare, and I decided to take those colors here. This project lead to advancing in css usage and first page responsiveness tries!
